The following **required** functionality is complete:

## Notes

This was my first time using Xcode and Swift so it was a little bit challenging to learn from scratch. I had fun adding a settings view and learning about defaults.
Styling the UI was challenging for me since I couldn't get dark mode to work with any colored background (so I chose gray instead). I'm looking forward to learning
iOS!
